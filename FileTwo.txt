When
your tired consciousness loses its balance,
when the steps of this ladder
go out from under your feet
like a deck,
when
your nocturnal loneliness spits on humanity,
you can
reflect on eternity
and doubt the purity
of ideas, hypotheses, perception
of a work of art,
and — by the way — the very conception
of the Madonna of the son of Jesus.
But it is better to worship the given
with its deep graves,
which later,
after a long time,
will seem so sweet.

Yes.
It is better to worship the given
with its short paths,
which will then

seem strangely to you
wide,
seem big,
dusty,
dotted with compromises,
they will seem like big wings,
they will seem like big birds.

Yes. It is better to worship the given
with its poor standards,
which then, to the extreme,
will serve as a railing for you
(although not particularly clean),
keeping
your limping truths in balance
on this chipped staircase.
